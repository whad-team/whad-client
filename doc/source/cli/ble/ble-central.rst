wble-central: Bluetooth Low Energy GATT client
==============================================

``wble-central`` provides a scanner that can be used to detect surrounding BLE devices
as well as a GATT client allowing to connect to a remote BLE device and access
its services and characteristics. This tool must be used with a device supporting
the *Bluetooth Low Energy* domain.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: text

    wble-central [OPTIONS] ([COMMAND] ([COMMAND ARGS]))

``wble-central`` accepts one or more options, and requires a valid command as its
first parameter. This command may or may not accepts arguments.

Command-line options
--------------------

**wble-central** supports the following options:

* ``--interface`` (``-i``): specifies the WHAD interface to use
* ``--bdaddr`` (``-b``): specifies a target Bluetooth Device address in the form *XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX*
* ``--file`` (``-f``): provides a script to execute
* ``--no-color``: disables colors in output

help
~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    $ wble-central help [command]

The ``help`` command provides useful help about any command implemented in ``wble-central``.

interactive
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    $ wble-central -i <interface> interactive

The ``interactive`` command provides an interactive shell allowing the user to
scan, connect and access a Bluetooth Low Energy device in an interactive way.

A WHAD interface name must be be provided through the ``--interface`` option for
this interactive shell to work properly. It will complain if you forget to provide
one.

profile
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    $ wble-central -i <interface> -b <bdaddress> scan

The ``profile`` command connects to a specific Bluetooth Low Energy device and queries its
services and characteristics. The ``--interface`` and ``--bdaddr`` options must be provided.

scan
~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    $ wble-central -i <interface> scan

The ``scan`` command searches for surrounding BLE devices and displays them in
the output. An interface must be provided with the ``--interface`` option for
this command to work properly.

~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    $ wble-central -i <interface> -b <address> read [UUID | handle]

The ``read`` command connects to a specified BLE device and reads a given characteristic.
The parameter passed to this command may be a valid characteristic UUID or a GATT handle.

.. code-block:: text

    $ wble-central -i hci0 -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 read 81
    00000000: 22 76 65 72 22 3A 22 34  22                       "ver":"4"


write
~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    $ wble-central -i <interface> -b <address> write [UUID | handle] [["hex"] VALUE]

The `write` command connects to a specified BLE device and writes a given characteristic
with a given value. Characteristic must be identified with its UUID or GATT handle. The
provided value can be a string or a HEX value.

.. code-block:: text

    $wble-central -i hci0 -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 write 42 "this is a test"
    $wble-central -i hci0 -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 read 42
    00000000: 74 68 69 73 20 69 73 20  61 20 74 65 73 74        this is a test

    $wble-central -i hci0 -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 write 42 hex 41 42 43
    $wble-central -i hci0 -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 read 42
    00000000: 41 42 43                                          ABC

writecmd
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    $ wble-central -i <interface> -b <address> write [UUID | handle] [["hex"] VALUE]

The ``writecmd`` command is similar to the previous ``write`` command, accepts the
same parameters, but sens a GATT *WriteRequestWithNoResponse* instead of a *WriteRequest*.

This type of write operation does not cause the remote device to acknowledge that the
data has been correctly written.

Interactive shell
-----------------

.. _central-interactive-shell:

The interactive shell offers the possibility to dynamically interact with any device,
with an helpful interface that provides autocompletion. This interactive shell implements
all the commands supported by ``wble-central`` in non-interactive mode plus some extra
commands.

~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    wireshark [on | off]

instance of **Wireshark**. This helps investigating GATT operations but also allows
saving capture packets as PCAP.

For instance, reading the characteristic with handle 22 of the currently connected
device while Wireshark is monitoring produces the following output in the interactive
shell:

.. code-block:: text

    wble-central|d0:d0:03:77:53:28> wireshark on
    wble-central|d0:d0:03:77:53:28> read 22

And the following output in Wireshark:

Quick tutorial

Scanning for available devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`whad-central` is the CLI tool to use when dealing with BLE devices. This tool is able
to scan, connect to a device and access its characteristics. It supports any
HCI adapter (exposed as a virtual WHAD device) that may be present in your computer.

The following command looks for any available BLE devices in a terminal, providing detailed
information about each discovered device:

.. code-block::

    $ wble-central -i hci1 scan
     RSSI Lvl  Type  BD Address        Extra info
    [ -61 dBm] [PUB] d0:d0:03:77:53:28 
    [ -87 dBm] [PUB] 40:b3:14:04:b7:07 
    [ -87 dBm] [PUB] 40:b3:14:04:b7:07 name:"SomeDevice"

The RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) is displayed as well as the BD address
type (public or random), the BD address and some extra information extracted from
the advertising records. But it is possible to get more information using the interactive
mode of *wble-central*, with the *info* command as shown below:

.. code-block::

    $ wble-central -i hci1 interactive
    wble-central> scan
     RSSI Lvl  Type  BD Address        Extra info
    [ -62 dBm] [PUB] d0:d0:03:77:53:28 
    [ -92 dBm] [PUB] 40:b3:14:04:b7:07

Connecting to a device and reading a characteristic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the interactive mode, we can connect to a device and searches its services
and characteristics using the **connect** and **profile** commands:

.. code-block:: text

    wble-central> connect 
    Successfully connected to target 40:b3:14:04:b7:07
    wble-central|40:b3:14:04:b7:07> profile
    Service 1801

    2A05 handle: 2, value handle: 3
    | access rights: indicate

    Service 1800

    2A00 handle: 21, value handle: 22
    | access rights: read
    2A01 handle: 23, value handle: 24
    | access rights: read
    2AA6 handle: 25, value handle: 26
    | access rights: read


Once connected, you can read any characteristic based on its value handle with
the *read* command, as shown below:

.. code-block:: text

    wble-central|40:b3:14:04:b7:07> read 22
    00000000: 53 6f 6d 65 44 65 76 69 63 65                  SomeDevice
