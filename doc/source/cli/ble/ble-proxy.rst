wble-proxy: Bluetooth Low Energy GATT and Link-layer Proxy
==========================================================

``wble-proxy`` provides a basic tool to proxify a BLE connection and monitor traffic
between both devices. This tool must be used with two WHAD devices supporting the
*Bluetooth Low Energy* domain.

    wble-proxy [OPTIONS] BDADDR

``wble-proxy`` accepts one or more options and requires the target BD address.

Command-line options
--------------------

**wble-proxy** supports the following options:

* ``--interface`` (``-i``): specifies the WHAD interface to use to connect to the target device
* ``--no-color``: disables colors in output
* ``--proxy-interface`` (``-p``): specifies the WHAD interface to use for the emulated device
* ``--timeout`` (``-t``): specifies the timeout (in seconds) used for target device discovery
* ``--wireshark`` (``-w``): spawns a wireshark instance that will monitor packets in real-time
* ``--spoof`` (``-s``): enable BD address spoofing, if the proxy WHAD interface supports it
* ``--link-layer``: enable link-layer mode (default mode is GATT)
* ``--output`` (``-o``): specifies a target PCAP file in which all exchanged packets will be saved

Create a GATT proxy and monitor traffic
---------------------------------------

``wble-proxy`` default mode is GATT, meaning it will use its default WHAD interface (specified
with the ``--interface`` option) to look for a target device and connect to it, and then create
an emulated BLE device exposed on a second interface (specified with ``--proxy-interface``) that
will have the exact same services and characteristics.

This proxy will catch any GATT read, write, notification or indication relative to a specific
characteristic and will relay it to the target device. Packets will be monitored in real-time
in a Wireshark instance if enabled, or saved in a PCAP file if an output path is provided 
with the ``--output`` option.

The following command line will create a BLE GATT proxy using interface ``uart0`` to search and
connect to the target device and then emulate a BLE peripheral on the proxy interface ``hci0``.
A wireshark instance will be created since the ``--wireshark`` option is specified, and a packet
dump will be saved into the provided output file.

Create a Link-layer proxy and monitor traffic
---------------------------------------------

``wble-proxy`` also provides a link-layer mode that works quite differently from its default
GATT mode. In GATT mode, ``wble-proxy`` connects to the target device, enumerates its
services and characteristics and use this information to create a new emulated BLE peripheral
with the exact same profile. In link-layer mode however, ``wble-proxy`` directly forward
BLE PDUs from one device to another, avoiding this services and characteristics discovery
process. This link-layer mode offers better performances than GATT mode, but the output of
``wble-proxy`` will be harder to read as there is no interpretation of the data exchanged between
the target device and the client connected to the emulated device.
