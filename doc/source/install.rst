Installation
=============

System dependencies
-------------------

First, you may need some specific system dependencies:

- Python3 development libraries (`apt install python3-dev` on Debian or Ubuntu)
- a working compiler as it is required to build some dependencies

On a Debian/Ubuntu *x86/x64* system:

```
$ sudo apt install gcc python3-dev binutils -y
```

On a Debian/Ubuntu *aarch64* system:

```
$ sudo apt install aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc binutils python3-dev -y`
```

.. note::

    If your system needs extra dependencies or requires special steps to be
    followed in order to flawlessly install WHAD, let us know by `creating an
    issue on our Github repository <https://github.com/whad-team/whad-client/issues/new/choose>`_ !

Installing WHAD with pip
------------------------

Installing WHAD is straightforward with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install whad

.. important::

    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment for WHAD in order to
    avoid any dependency collision, see `this tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_.

    You can also use `pipx <https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/>`_ instead of *pip*, as it manages its own virtual environments.

Installing WHAD from our Github repository
------------------------------------------

Another solution is to get the source from github directly and install the framework
with the classic Python tools.

Then clone the repository, create a virtual environment and install it:

.. code-block:: text

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/whad-team/whad-client.git
    $ cd whad-client
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ . ./venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    (venv)$ pip install .

.. important::

    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment for WHAD in order to
    avoid any dependency collision, see `this tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_.

Installing rules for WHAD-compatible devices
--------------------------------------------

By default, interacting with most WHAD-compatible devices require root permissions.

To allow a normal user to interact with them, a simple tool named ``winstall`` is included in whad.
It can automatically install rules & configure permissions for the supported devices.

To install the rules for all devices, just run the following command:

.. code-block:: text

    $ winstall --rules all

A prompt will ask your password to elevate your privileges, then rules and permissions will be automatically configured.
On some system, it may be necessary to logout in order to apply changes.

If you prefer to install rules for a specific device, replace 'all' by the device you want to configure:

.. code-block:: text

    # Install rules for HCI devices
    $ winstall --rules hci

    # Install rules for ButteRFly device (nRF52840 dongle - pca10059 or Makerdiary MDK nrf52 dongle)
    $ winstall --rules butterfly

    # Install rules for nodeMCU ESP-32
    $ winstall --rules esp

    # Install rules for nucleo STM32-WL55
    $ winstall --rules nucleowl55

    # Install rules for LoRa e5 mini dongle
    $ winstall --rules lorae5mini

    # Install rules for Ubertooth One
    $ winstall --rules ubertooth

    # Install rules for Yard Stick One
    $ winstall --rules yardstickone

    # Install rules for RFStorm device (CrazyRadio PA / Logitech Unifying dongle)
    $ winstall --rules rfstorm

    # Install rules for APIMote device
    $ winstall --rules apimote

    # Install rules for RZUSBStick
    $ winstall --rules rzusbstickrfstorm


Flashing firmware on WHAD-compatible devices
---------------------------------------------

``winstall`` tool also allows to flash the latest available firmware on various WHAD-enabled devices.

Plug your device on your computer, and check if it is correctly detected using ``--list`` option:

.. code-block:: text

    $ winstall --list
    [!] Detected devices:

    - Ubertooth One:  0
      Command (install rules): winstall --rules ubertooth
      Command (flash firmware): winstall --flash ubertooth --port 0

    - Espressif ESP-32 board:  /dev/ttyUSB0
    Command (install rules): winstall --rules esp
    Command (flash firmware): winstall --flash esp --port /dev/ttyUSB0

    - HCI device:  hci0
    Command (install rules): winstall --rules hci

Then, flash the latest device using the ``--flash`` option (you can provide a specific port using ``--port``):

.. code-block:: text

    $ winstall --flash ubertooth
    [!] This tool must run as root, let's elevate your privileges !
    [...]
    [!] Flashing ubertooth device ...
    Latest ubertooth release: 2020-12-R1
    [!] Running command: tar -xf /tmp/ubertooth-2020-12-R1.tar.xz
    [!] Running command: ubertooth-dfu -d bluetooth_rxtx.dfu -r
    Flashing successful for device 'ubertooth'.

Once correctly flashed, you should be able to see the available devices using ``wup`` / ``whadup``:

.. code-block:: text

    $ whadup
    [i] Available devices
    - ubertooth0
      Type: UbertoothDevice
      Index: 0
      Identifier: 16b00016c61435aeaec24253811e00f5

    - hci0
      Type: HCIDevice
      Index: 0
      Identifier: hci0

    - uart0
      Type: UartDevice
      Index: 0
      Identifier: /dev/ttyUSB0


Installing WHAD in a virtual machine
------------------------------------

WHAD can be installed in a virtual machine rather than on a host using the
procedure described above. However, some virtualization softwares required
specific settings to allow all the features of WHAD.

The following table summarizes the supported virtualization softwares and the
OSes used to run them, as well as the recommended guest OSes for each of them.

================ ================ ================ ================= ================
 Software        ARM macOS Host   x86 macOS Host   x86 Windows Host  x86 Linux Host
================ ================ ================ ================= ================
 VMWare          Ubuntu 24.04 (1) Ubuntu 24.04 (1) Ubuntu 24.04 (01) Ubuntu 24.04 (1)
 VirtualBox      *Untested*       Ubuntu 24.04     Ubuntu 24.04      Ubuntu 24.04
================ ================ ================ ================= ================

Using VMWare virtualization software (1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our tests with the recommended guest OS Ubuntu 22.04 showed that the USB core
driver has its *autosuspend* feature enabled by default, causing issues with
any USB bluetooth dongle plugged into the virtual machine.

This behavior can be disabled by setting the `autosuspend` option to `-1` in
the system boot command-line, by running the following commands in a terminal
in the target VM:


.. code-block:: shell

    sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="[a-z ]*/& usbcore.autosuspend=-1/' /etc/default/grub
    sudo update-grub2


The VM then needs to be restarted for this modification to take effect.
Once restarted, the system should automatically stop suspending
any USB device plugged into the virtual machine.

.. note::

    On native Linux systems, the USB core *autosuspend* feature works as expected and
    should not be disabled.

.. important::

    Unlike stated in a previous version of this documentation, The *Bluetooth* service
    running by default in Ubuntu VMs does not need to be stopped, WHAD solely relies on
    HCI user sockets to control bluetooth-enabled adapters and therefore takes ownership,
    avoiding the *Bluetooth* service to interact with them while in use by WHAD.

    This also means `bluetoothctl` and WHAD will both work out of the box, no modification
    required.
