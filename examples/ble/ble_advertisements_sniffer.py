"""Bluetooth Low Energy advertisements sniffing

This example code shows how to use WHAD to sniff BLE advertisements broadcasted
by devices in range, using a BLE sniffer (HCI not supported in this case).

As an example, to sniff advertisements using a WHAD compatible hardware identified
by `uart0`:

$ python3 ble_advertisements_sniffer.py uart0
