"""This module provides specific classes to set-up a BLE proxy.

The class :class:`LinkLayerProxy` provides a link-layer level BLE proxy that
will connect to a target device, spawns another device and relay control and
data PDUs between a client and the target device.

The class :class:`GattProxy` provides a GATT BLE proxy that will connect to a
target device, creates another device and relay GATT operations (characteristic
read, write, notification and indication) between a client and the target
device.
