BLE Scanner connector
=====================

This module provides a scanner connector :class:`whad.ble.connector.scanner.Scanner`
for WHAD BLE devices, allowing to discover available BLE devices.

It implements two different scanning approaches:

* The first one is based on a *normal device scanning* based on WHAD BLE protocol:
  it puts the hardware adapter in device discovery mode and grab each advertisement
  received.

* The second one puts the hardware adapter in *sniffing mode* and sniffs advertisements
  sent on default channels. This mode is only available with WHAD devices that support
  sniffing.

This connector must be instantiated with a compatible WHAD device, as shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    device = WhadDevice.create('uart0')
    scanner = Scanner(device)

If the underlying device does not support scanning, this connector will raise
an :class:`UnsupportedCapability` exception.
