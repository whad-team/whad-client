"""
WHAD default device connector module.

This module provides a default connector class `WhadDeviceConnector` that
implements all the basic features of a device connector:

- Sending and receiving messages
- A synchronous mode used for message sniffing and processing
- A locked mode (enabled by default) to temporarily save messages while the connector
  is initializing (no more message lost)
- A dedicated notification manager and basic notification class to allow external objects
  to subscribe for specific notifications.
