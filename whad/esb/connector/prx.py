"""
This module provides a ::class:`whad.esb.connector.prx.PRX` connector that
implements Nordic Semiconductor's *Primary Receiver* role.

The *primary receiver* (*PRX*) role consists in receiving packets from other devices
and sending acknowledgements if required to the sending device. When a device
is in *PRX* mode, it is only capable of receiving ESB packets on a specific
channel, including *ESB pings*.

The :class:`whad.esb.connector.prx.PRX` class relies on a custom protocol stack
to handle acknowledgements and pings automatically.
