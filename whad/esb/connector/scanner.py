"""
This module provides a scanner connector :class:`whad.esb.connector.scanner.Scanner`
for WHAD ESB devices, allowing to discover available Enhanced ShockBurst devices.

It relies on the use of the WHAD ESB protocol. It puts the hardware adapter in
pseudo-promiscuous sniffing mode and iterates over the channels to discover
Enhanced ShockBurst communications. The packets are then processed to extract
device informations.


This mode is only available with WHAD devices that support promiscuous sniffing.

This connector must be instantiated with a compatible WHAD device, as shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    device = WhadDevice.create('uart0')
    scanner = Scanner(device)

If the underlying device does not support promiscuous sniffing, this connector will raise
an :class:`UnsupportedCapability` exception.
