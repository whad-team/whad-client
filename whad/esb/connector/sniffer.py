"""
This module provides a :class:`Sniffer` class that derives from :class:`ESB`
to allow *Enhanced ShockBurst* frame sniffing. Sniffed frames are wrapped in
a dedicated *Scapy* layer and therefore are represented as *Scapy* packets.

This :class:`Sniffer` class is used by the generic `wsniff` utility when
*Enhanced ShockBurst* protocol is selected, and the associated
:class:`whad.esb.sniffing.SnifferConfiguration` class holds all the sniffing
parameters that can be set.

By default, the *Enhanced ShockBurst* sniffer sniffs packet on all channels by
looping from channel 0 to 100 over and over and capturing frames that match
the expected format.
